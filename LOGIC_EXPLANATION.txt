# Application Logic - Simple Explanation

## Overview
This tool helps analyze how international financial aid (grants) affects currency values in developing countries, and identifies unusual currency movements.

## 1. Grant Impact Analysis

### What We Measure
When a country receives a large grant, we check if the currency became stronger or weaker in the following weeks.

### How We Score Impact (0-100)

**Three Key Factors:**

1. **Trend Change (30% weight)**
   - Did the currency's direction change after the grant?
   - Example: If currency was weakening before, did it start strengthening after?
   - Score: 0 = no change, 100 = complete reversal

2. **Volatility Change (50% weight)**
   - Did the currency become more stable or more unstable?
   - We prefer less volatility (more stability)
   - Score: 100 = much more stable, 0 = much more unstable

3. **Magnitude (20% weight)**
   - How much did the currency value actually change?
   - Bigger changes = higher scores
   - Score based on percentage movement

**Final Score:** Combines all three factors to give a 0-100 rating
- 80-100: Strong positive impact
- 60-79: Moderate impact
- 40-59: Weak impact
- Below 40: Minimal or negative impact

## 2. Anomaly Detection

### What We Look For
Unusual currency movements - when a currency changes by more than 15% in less than 30 days.

### Detection Parameters
- **Volatility Threshold:** How big the change must be (e.g., 15%)
- **Time Window:** How quickly it happened (e.g., 30 days)

### Why It Matters
Sharp currency movements often signal economic events that need investigation.

## 3. Correlation Analysis

When we find an unusual movement, we check for possible causes:

### A. Grant Disbursements
- **What:** Did the country receive aid around this time?
- **Window:** ±7 to ±60 days around the movement
- **Result:** Shows if grants might have triggered the change

### B. Commodity Price Movements
- **What:** Did key export prices change significantly?
- **Examples:** 
  - Ghana → Gold, Cocoa prices
  - Colombia → Oil, Coffee prices
- **Threshold:** Changes over 10%
- **Why:** Export prices directly affect currency demand

### C. External Events
- **News:** Major economic or political news
- **Policy Rates:** Central bank interest rate changes
- **IMF Releases:** International Monetary Fund announcements

### Correlation Indicators
We mark anomalies with icons to show what correlations exist:
- 💰 = Grant found nearby
- 🌾 = Significant commodity movement
- 📰 = Related news articles

## 4. Data Time Periods

### Default Analysis Window
- **Historical Data:** From 2010 to present
- **Grant Analysis:** Compares 4-12 weeks before/after grant
- **Anomaly Search:** Scans entire dataset

### Why Historical Data?
- Shows patterns over time
- Identifies if current situations are unusual
- Validates relationships between grants and currency

## 5. Confidence & Reliability

### What Makes Results Reliable?
1. **Multiple Data Sources:** 
   - Yahoo Finance (FX rates, commodities)
   - IMF & World Bank (grant data)
   - Economic APIs (policy rates, news)

2. **Outlier Removal:**
   - Removes bad data points (e.g., obvious errors)
   - Uses statistical methods (3-sigma rule)

3. **Caching Strategy:**
   - Stores results to avoid repetitive calculations
   - 12-hour refresh for market data

### Limitations to Mention
- Correlation ≠ Causation (just because they happen together doesn't mean one caused the other)
- Many factors affect currencies simultaneously
- News coverage may be incomplete for some periods
